# Abstraction

### Definition
It is the process of hiding or abstracting away complex details of a system or
software component to make it easier to use and understand. One common form is data abstraction,
which involves creating abstract data types that encapsulate data and related operations, and hiding the implementation details from the user.

# Attributes/Properties

### Definition
Attributes, or properties, are defined as part of a class and are used to represent the state or characteristics of an object.

# Class

### Definition
A class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data and functions into 
a single unit. A class can be seen as a blueprint or template for creating objects that share a common set of characteristics and behavior.

# Class Variable

## Definition
A class variable, also known as a static data member, is a variable that is shared
among all instances or objects of a class. Unlike instance variables,
which have a separate copy for each object, a class variable has only one copy that is shared by all objects of the class.

# Composition

### Definition
composition is a design technique where a class contains one or more
objects of other classes as member variables. This means that the class "composes" or is made up of other classes.

# Constructor

### Definition
A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.
They have the same name as the class and are defined within the class.
They do not have a return type and cannot be called directly like regular methods.

# Destructor

### Definition
The purpose of a destructor is to clean up any resources that the object may have allocated during its lifetime.
The destructor for a class is automatically called when the object is destroyed or goes out of scope. Its syntax is 
represented by a (~)

# Encapsulation

### Definition
An object-oriented programming concept that refers to the ability of an object to hide its
internal state, data, and implementation details from other objects.

# Friends

### Definition
A friend class can access private and protected members of other classes in which it is declared as a friend. 
To declare a class as a friend of another class, the friend keyword is used in the class declaration of the class that is being granted access.

# Inheritance

### Definition
Inheritance is were the existing class is known as the base or parent class, while the new class is known as the derived or child class. The child class inherits properties and behaviors from its parent class, allowing it to reuse and extend the parent's functionality.
Inheritance is typically used to model an "is-a" relationship between classes.

For example, a car "is-a" vehicle, so a Car class can inherit from a Vehicle class, which may already contain properties and methods relevant to all vehicles. The Car class can then add its own properties and methods specific to cars.
