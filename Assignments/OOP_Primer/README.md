# Abstraction

## Definition
It is the process of hiding or abstracting away complex details of a system or
software component to make it easier to use and understand. One common form is data abstraction,
which involves creating abstract data types that encapsulate data and related operations, and hiding the implementation details from the user.

# Attributes/Properties

Attributes, or properties, are defined as part of a class and are used to represent the state or characteristics of an object.

# Class

## Definition
A class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data and functions into
