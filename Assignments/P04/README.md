## P04 - Graphiz Class
### Dominique Hawkins
### Description:
  This program defines two classes, Die and Dice, that simulate the rolling of dice.
  The Die class represents a single die with a certain number of sides, and has a method roll() that returns a random value between 1 and the number of sides of the die.
  The Dice class represents a collection of dice with the same number of sides. It has methods to calculate the sum, maximum, minimum, and average of the values obtained
  by rolling the dice. It also has a method roll() that returns the sum, maximum, minimum, or average of the dice values depending on a parameter passed in.
