### Dominique Hawkins
### Description: 
This program is for creating a Linked List based vector class and 
   			demonstrate my ability to create a beginner level class. This is done
			by creating a linked list class that allow for pushing data (ints) to 
			to both ends of the list, at any position and also sort the list and 
			place the approipriate position, and push another vector onto another. 
			It will also allows you to pop items off the front and rear and at a 
	  		position and find the position of an item. This List will also allow you 
 			create the list using a array, items from an input file, and another vector.
