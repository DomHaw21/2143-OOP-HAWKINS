## Vector Class
### Dominique Hawkins
### Description: 
		This program is creating a Linked List based vector class and is
   		demonstrating my ability to create a low level class. This is done
		by creating a linked list class that allows for pushing data  																		to the front/back of the list, at any position, sort the list and
		place a value in the right position, and also push a vector onto another. 
		It also allows you to pop items off the front and rear, at a certain
	  	position, and find the position of an item. It will also allow you 
 		create the list using a array, items from an input file, and another vector.
