### Dominique Hawkins
### Description: 
		This program creates a Linked List vector class and shows
   		my ability to create a low level class. 
		It allows you to pop items off the front, rear, at a certain
	  	position, and find the position of an item. It will also allow you 
 		create the list using other arrays, items from an input file, and another vector.
